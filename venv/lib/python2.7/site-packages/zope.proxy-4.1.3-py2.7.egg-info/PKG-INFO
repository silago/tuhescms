Description: 
        ===========================
        Generic Transparent Proxies
        ===========================
        
        Proxies are special objects which serve as mostly-transparent
        wrappers around another object, intervening in the apparent behavior of
        the wrapped object only when necessary to apply the policy (e.g., access
        checking, location brokering, etc.) for which the proxy is responsible.
        
        Editorial note:
        
           Unfortunately, we don't have separate documentation for `zope.proxy`
           at this time.  This is a shame because they are generically useful.
           We are publishing this release without documentation mainly because
           it is a dependency of other releases.

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        4.1.3 (2013-03-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed interface object introspection in PyPy. For some reason PyPy made
          attributes available despite the restrictive ``__slots__`` declaration.
        
        - Added a bunch of tests surrounding interface lookup and adaptation.
        
        
        4.1.2 (2013-03-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed ``PyProxyBase.__iter__()`` to return the result of
          ``PyProxyBase._wrapped.__iter__`` if available, otherwise fall back to
          Python internals. The previous implementation always created a generator.
        
        - Fixed ``PyProxyBase.__setattr__()`` to allow setting of properties on the
          proxy itself. This is needed to properly allow proxy extensions as was
          evidenced int he ``zope.security.decorator`` module.
        
        4.1.1 (2012-12-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Fleshed out PyPI Trove classifiers.
        
        4.1.0 (2012-12-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Enabled compilation of dependent modules under Py3k.
        
        - Replaced use of ``PyCObject`` APIs with equivalent ``PyCapsule`` APIs,
          except under Python 2.6.
        
          N.B.  This change is an ABI incompatibility under Python 2.7:
                extensions built under Python 2.7 against 4.0.x versions of
                ``zope.proxy`` must be rebuilt.
        
        4.0.1 (2012-11-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Added support for Python 3.3.
        
        4.0.0 (2012-06-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Added support for PyPy.
        
          N.B.:  the C extension is *not* built under PyPy.
        
        - Added a pure-Python reference / fallback implementations of
          ``zope.proxy.ProxyBase`` and the proxy module API functions.
        
          N.B.:  the pure-Python proxy implements all regular features of
          ``ProxyBase``;  however, it does not exclude access to the wrapped object
          in the same way that the C version does.  If you need that information
          hiding (e.g., to implement security sandboxing), you still need to use
          the C version.
        
        - Added support for continuous integration using ``tox`` and ``jenkins``.
        
        - 100% unit test coverage.
        
        - Added Sphinx documentation:  moved doctest examples to API reference.
        
        - Added 'setup.py docs' alias (installs ``Sphinx`` and dependencies).
        
        - Added 'setup.py dev' alias (runs ``setup.py develop`` plus installs
          ``nose`` and ``coverage``).
        
        - Replaced deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent
          ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.
        
        - Dropped support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.
        
        - Added Python 3.2 support.
        
        3.6.1 (2010-07-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Make tests compatible with Python 2.7.
        
        3.6.0 (2010-04-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed test extra and the remaining dependency on zope.testing.
        
        - Removed use of 'zope.testing.doctestunit' in favor of stdlib's 'doctest.
        
        3.5.0 (2009/01/31)
        ------------------
        
        - Added support to bootstrap on Jython.
        
        - Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.
        
        3.4.2 (2008/07/27)
        ------------------
        
        - Made C code compatible with Python 2.5 on 64bit architectures.
        
        3.4.1 (2008/06/24)
        ------------------
        
        - Bug: Updated `setup.py` script to conform to common layout. Also updated
          some of the fields.
        
        - Bug: The behavior of tuples and lists in the `__getslice__()` and
          `__setslice__()` method were incorrect by not honoring the pre-cooked
          indices. See http://docs.python.org/ref/sequence-methods.html.
        
        3.4.0 (2007/07/12)
        ------------------
        
        - Feature: Added a decorator module that supports declaring interfaces on
          proxies that get blended with the interfaces of the things they proxy.
        
        3.3.0 (2006/12/20)
        ------------------
        
        - Corresponds to the verison of the `zope.proxy` package shipped as part of
          the Zope 3.3.0 release.
        
        
        3.2.0 (2006/01/05)
        ------------------
        
        - Corresponds to the verison of the zope.proxy package shipped as part of
          the Zope 3.2.0 release.
        
        
        3.0.0 (2004/11/07)
        ------------------
        
        - Corresponds to the verison of the zope.proxy package shipped as part of
          the Zope X3.0.0 release.
